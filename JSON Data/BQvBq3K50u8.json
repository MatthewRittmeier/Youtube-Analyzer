            "Description": "The last time I made a video where I actually explained my code, I had around 50 subscribers, so I'm not sure if you folks are interested in this type of thing. Here's an explanation video anyway; I added some more demos in it to make things interesting, so let's see how it goes. Also wanted to give proper closure to my first project that got relatively popular (I'll still play Bad Apple!! on stuff, this is just my last video about Desmos).\n\nSee it on GitHub: https://github.com/kevinjycui/DesmosBezierRenderer\n\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/WEykWbjkR2\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Junferno\nCheck out my other stuff on GitHub: https://github.com/kevinjycui\n\nCommunity Captions\nPortuguese (Brazil) - Guilherme BR"
