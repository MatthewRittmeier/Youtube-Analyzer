Here's mine:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\n\nThe Ferdinand in War Thunder is a German Tank Destroyer with a LOT of armor.  With a 200mm upper plate and two overlapping 100mm plates on the hull, most tanks will struggle to penetrate you.  The problem is, the Ferdinand has a few weaknesses.\n\nThe Ferdinand has the infamous Long 88 cannon that can punch through ove 200mm of armor even at long range.  It's got a great reload for the damage it can deal but the problem is your chassis.  Based on a Hybrid system, this tank is extremely overweight meaning it's pretty cumbersome to drive around.\n\nCouple this vehicles lack of mobility and the fact the armor has some glaringly obvious weakspots, most of your time is going to be spent immobilized in a fight.  Passive play is required but in the right situation you can be a nightmare!\n\nSlow... but fun! :)\n\n-----SUPPORT ME-----\n\nBuy My Decal:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\nMerch:  https://oddbawz-shop.fourthwall.com/en-gbp/\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/oddbawz\n\n-----SOCIALS-----\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/OddBawZ\nBusiness Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nCar Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@BamikazeGarage"
