It is also surprisingly tanky. Due to its very poor depression angles it is basically only useable on city maps, but it is still a very fun machine to use. I wish Gaijin would add more vehicles like it.\n\nCheck the channel \"About\" section for the link to the creator of my profile picture.\n\nSongs used (in order from first to last):\nCommand and Conquer: Generals - Fight For Peace, Makin' A Sweep, Zero Fight For Peace, In The Field\nHalo 3: ODST - Rain (Deference for Darkness)\n\nSound mods: \nEpic Thunder (Pre-release)\nGunner HEAT PC Crew Voices Mod (Personal, go play the game: https://gunnerheatpc.com/ )\n\nSponsor: https://apexpartner.app/redirect/spookston\nSecond channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_z0IvBt9VKgVY9_CgThzIA\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/spookston\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Spookston\nReddit: /u/spookston\nDiscord: See my Patreon page.\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/spookstonwt\nSteam: https://goo.gl/BYQjC9\n\n#warthunder\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #tanks\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #tankhistory \nThe King Of Artillery In War Thunder"
