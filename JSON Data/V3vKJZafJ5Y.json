Here's mine:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\n\nThe RBT-5 in War Thunder is a VERY old Premium Event vehicle for the Russian Tech Tree.  It's basically a BT-5 that has 2 absolutely MASSIVE 425mm rockets stuck to the roof.  I had absolutely NO idea just how fun this tank would turn out to be.\n\nThe Rocket slash Land Torpedoes this tank fires are completely fixed in elevation so you have to be pretty inventive in how you use them.  The good news is, anything in proximity to the TT-250 rockets from the BRT5 are very likely going to explode! :)\n\nThis is honestly the most I've ever laughed in a War Thunder video.  EASILY!\n\nI actually cannot believe how many people we got with this thing.  Outstanding and well worth the $60!\n\n-----SUPPORT ME-----\n\nBuy My Decal:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\nMerch:  https://oddbawz-shop.fourthwall.com/en-gbp/\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/oddbawz\n\n-----SOCIALS-----\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/OddBawZ\nBusiness Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nCar Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@BamikazeGarage"
