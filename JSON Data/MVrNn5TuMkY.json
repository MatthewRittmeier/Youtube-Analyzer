            "Description": "The squeakquel. Taking a bezier curve approach as opposed to linear approximations. The remix used in this video is slightly different from the song, but it's the only way I could get around copyright claims. Video sped up. Uses Desmos API, Potrace, Python PIL.\n\nDiscord server: https://discord.gg/WEykWbjkR2\nCheck out my other stuff on GitHub: https://github.com/kevinjycui\n\nMusic used: ZahranW - Bad Apple!! 8bit remix (Touhou: Lotus Land Story) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNm85uXR3RM"
