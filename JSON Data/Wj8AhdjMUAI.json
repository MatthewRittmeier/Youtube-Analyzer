It doesn't have much going for it, but it is very reactive and works quite well. If you're grinding the US tech tree, I would recommend trying it.\n\nCheck the channel \"About\" section for the link to the creator of my profile picture.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/spookston\n\n#warthunder\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #tanks\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #warthundergameplay  \nThe Tank Everyone Forgets"
