            "Description": "REMAN: to man again or anew.\nCrew skills are a crucial aspect in Ground battles. Although often overlooked, these skills can increase your tank's performance by a significant amount. Today, I explain every single tank crew skill with visual guides. This is a remake of one of my first videos, and I've corrected several mistakes, given it a fresh new voice-over and visuals and made it much more accurate. It's also a remake of a remake, which somehow managed to be worse than its original video lol. This time, I actually did research and tested how the skills work in-game, and the voice-over doesn't sound like I'm rapping.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 TIMESTAMPS \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\ud83d\udcd8 0:00 Intro\n0:15 How crew skills work\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 2:48 Generic skills\n3:19 Keen Vision\n5:55 Field Repair\n6:25 Agility\n6:44 Vitality\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 7:21 Unique skills\n7:29 Tank driving\n8:48 Targeting\n9:44 Rangefinding\n10:23 Leadership\n10:45 Weapon reloading\n11:24 Artillery targeting accuracy\n11:47 Artillery strike calling time\n12:11 Radio communication\n12:32 Repair speed\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 13:28 Conclusion: what to upgrade first, etc.\n\ud83d\udcd8 16:08 Outro\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u2022 Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/d9QGse4Mzy\n\u2022 Song used: Joakim Karud - Dreams (https://youtu.be/tLcfHqjDpBg)\nSpecial thanks to Niels for helping out with the testing"
