Here's mine:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\n\nThe A-10A in War Thunder is a Premium Strike Aircraft for the US Tech Tree.  Armed with the famous GAU-12 30mm cannon but also the thing that makes it really devastating is the AGM-65B Mavericks.  The problem is, the seekers on the Mavericks right now are an absolute joke!\n\nThe AGM-65B seeker decides what it wants to do.  It won't lock or it will lock but not track the target.  It'll just start tracking a spec of dust flying through the air... who knows what it's doing but it's really frustrating.\n\nThe A-10A is still kinda fun but it's at a battle rating where you don't get much use from the main attraction which is the 30mm cannon.  10.3 is a rough spot for USA in Ground Realistic and that certainly doesn't help this plane.\n\nThe golden era of the Warthog is gone! :(\n\n-----SUPPORT ME-----\n\nBuy My Decal:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\nMerch:  https://oddbawz-shop.fourthwall.com/en-gbp/\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/oddbawz\n\n-----SOCIALS-----\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/OddBawZ\nBusiness Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nCar Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@BamikazeGarage"
