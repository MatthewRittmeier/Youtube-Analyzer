Here's mine:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\n\nThe Conway in War Thunder is a British Tank destroyer with the highest penetrating APDS in the game.  It shares this accolade with the Conqueror but it lacks a stabilizer and a chassis with armor.\n\nThe Conway is a Brit Mains best support tank for those larger maps where pesky Heavy tanks are roaming around.  It's just a bit sad it's at 7.0 where it doesn't really have a lineup before reaching the Conqueror at 7.7 when it's just not really viable anymore.\n\nI suspected I'd struggle with this tank due to past experiences but it turns out, it's not so bad! :)\n\n-----SUPPORT ME-----\n\nBuy My Decal:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\nMerch:  https://oddbawz-shop.fourthwall.com/en-gbp/\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/oddbawz\n\n-----SOCIALS-----\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/OddBawZ\nBusiness Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nCar Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@BamikazeGarage"
