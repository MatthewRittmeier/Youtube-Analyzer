            "Description": "RUSH E but in a graphing calculator! (Desmos). To record, I split it into octaves and shifted the tuning accordingly. If you would like to try out the graph, unfortunately you can only play one octave of each part at a time. Likewise, due to the massive size of the equations, it can take a few minutes for the plots to show up, so just bear with as it loads! You need to have a decent amount of memory as well. Here is the link to the graph: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lsnyus8jox"
