Here's mine:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\n\nThe PLZ83-130 Inferno Cannon in War Thunder was an event tank for China that is now only available on the Gaijin Market.  This Tank Destroyer houses a 130mm cannon that fires the same shell as the infamous IS-7 but at the BR of only 7.3!\n\nThe PLZ83-130 is pretty squishy.  With very little armor protection and a GIANT turret profile, it's a very easy target to hit.  The problem is, enemy tanks are very unlikely to survive a direct hit.  Even the Tiger 2 and American T34 can't bounce this cannon.  THAT is how powerful it is.\n\nSadly, there is no lineup for the PLZ83, meaning this will be your main tank and backed up with a 7.0 tank and some 6.7 tanks.  By the time you go to 8.0, the tank is pretty much useless due to the Medium tanks available to you at that BR.\n\nShame! :)\n\n-----SUPPORT ME-----\n\nBuy My Decal:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\nMerch:  https://oddbawz-shop.fourthwall.com/en-gbp/\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/oddbawz\n\n-----SOCIALS-----\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/OddBawZ\nBusiness Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nCar Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@BamikazeGarage"
