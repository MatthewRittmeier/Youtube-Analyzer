            "Description": "So after a very long time I dropped some WT realistic ground battles, decided to hop into my fav 6.0 BR with panthers and tigers and p.....planes....a bunch of mothertrucking planes. There's more planes than tanks...  \n\nImagine if GROUND battles were actually ground vehicles against ground vehicles....I know right.  \n\nAt least it gave me a chance to show my AA skills.  \n\nEnjoy and have fun watching ;)  \n\nIf you want to support the channel you can either follow &amp; subscribe here: [https://www.twitch.tv/flambass](https://www.twitch.tv/flambass)  \n\nOR directly donate here: [https://twitch.streamlabs.com/flambass](https://twitch.streamlabs.com/flambass)  \n\nWT invite link - [http://warthunder.com/en/registration?r=userinvite_25996107](http://warthunder.com/en/registration?r=userinvite_25996107)  \n\nVisit my merch shop - [https://streamlabs.com/flambass/#/merch](https://streamlabs.com/flambass/#/merch)  \n\nSupport me on Patreon - [https://www.patreon.com/Flambass](https://www.patreon.com/Flambass)  \n\nJoin the team on Discord - [https://discord.com/invite/flambass](https://discord.com/invite/flambass)  \n\nFollow me on Twitter - [https://twitter.com/Flambass_EU](https://twitter.com/Flambass_EU)   -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/flambass"
