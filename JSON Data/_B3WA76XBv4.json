With potent APHE rounds and a rapid 3.0s reload rate, it makes for the perfect ambush vehicle. It is also fairly versatile, though the armor is not good at all.  Gaijin did nerf its replenishment since the last update, however.\n\nCheck the channel \"About\" section for the link to the creator of my profile picture.\n\nSongs used (in order from first to last):\nCommand and Conquer: Generals - Makin' A Sweep, Fight For Peace, In The Field, Comanche Down\nHalo 3: ODST - Rain (Deference for Darkness)\n\nSound mods: \nEpic Thunder (Pre-release)\nGunner HEAT PC Crew Voices Mod (Personal, go play the game: https://gunnerheatpc.com/ )\n\nSponsor: https://apexpartner.app/redirect/spookston\nSecond channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_z0IvBt9VKgVY9_CgThzIA\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/spookston\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Spookston\nReddit: /u/spookston\nDiscord: See my Patreon page.\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/spookstonwt\nSteam: https://goo.gl/BYQjC9\n\n#warthunder\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #tanks\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #tankhistory \nThe Most Insane Medium Tank"
