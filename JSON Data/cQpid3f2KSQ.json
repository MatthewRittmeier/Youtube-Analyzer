            "ChannelName": "Jake Walker",
            "Description": "For about 3 years now, I\u2019ve been using the Desmos graphing calculator to make art and effects, learning more and more about it over time. This video is a collection of some of my favorite graphs that I\u2019ve made in that time, including ones I\u2019ve made for Desmos global art contests that are held annually. Everything shown off in this video was made with math expressions as well as all the other tools that Desmos has to offer.\n\nThis video took me a while to put together. I meant to finish it a while ago but I kept getting held back on it. Hope you enjoy it!\n\nGRAPH LINKS:\n\u2022 Earth? - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yhhy6fh3eb \n\u2022 Spirograph Thing - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2xpgicygu4 \n\u2022 The Starmaker - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jts3ainhpz \n\u2022 City of Nowhere - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/imuw3md5jl \n\u2022 Nova - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/a5dvpeoz01 \n\u2022 Chaos Effect - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/eskrrfggfy \n\u2022 Lay Bulls - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/glhvbmpwx1 \n\u2022 Clutter Cube - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nebfewd4ur \n\u2022 Sun and Clouds and Seagulls Scene - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nkd3ievzfg \n\u2022 Abyss - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z8r2jkpxgo \n\u2022 Cubiverse - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3zvvgof4jv \n\u2022 LIMITLESS - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dgpmfuak6f \n\u2022 Math: Final Boss - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/u6nxdjq31x \n\nSONGS USED:\n\u2022 Constellation - Jarvis9999\n\u2022 Greenpath - Christopher Larkin (Hollow Knight OST)\n\u2022 Starmaker Short - Jake Walker (me)\n\u2022 It\u2019s Raining Somewhere Else - Toby Fox (Undertale OST)\n\u2022 Farewell - Lena Raine (Celeste OST)\n\u2022 Another Medium - Toby Fox (Undertale OST)\n\u2022 void - DM Dokuro (Terraria: Calamity Mod OST)\n\u2022 Starfruit Supernova (Pillars of Creation Mix) - Catapillie (Celeste: Strawberry Jam Mod OST)\n\u2022 Passionfruit Pantheon (Apotheosis Mix) - BeanJammin (Celeste: Strawberry Jam Mod OST)\n\u2022 Bluebird - Minecire (Celeste: Strawberry Jam Mod OST)\n\nIntro: 0:00\nEarth?: 0:35\nSpirograph Thing: 1:18\nThe Starmaker: 1:47\nCity of Nowhere: 2:32\nNova: 3:21\nChaos Effect: 4:12\nLay Bulls: 4:58\nClutter Cube: 5:29\nSun and Clouds and Seagulls Scene: 6:29\nAbyss: 6:54\nThe Contest Submissions: 7:26\nCubiverse: 8:21\nLIMITLESS: 9:00\nMath: Final Boss: 10:03\nOutro: 11:08\n\n\nHello, it's me, the bottom of the description.
