The M109 in War Thunder is the go to SPAG when it comes to deleting anything that is unfortunate enough to drive out in front of you.  With a 155mm cannon and a huge HE shell with 61mm of penetration, this guy can pretty much do it all!\n\nOh, and if you want to have some real fun... load up a proximity fuse round and swat the enemy from the sky or when they're behind cover!  EXTREMELY fun and very effective.  Maybe... too effective! :)\n\n-----SUPPORT ME-----\n\nBuy My Decal:  https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&partner=Oddbawz&partner_val=2bpa5qx4\nMerch:  https://oddbawz-shop.fourthwall.com/en-gbp/\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/oddbawz\n\n-----SOCIALS-----\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/OddBawZ\nBusiness Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz\nCar Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/@BamikazeGarage"
