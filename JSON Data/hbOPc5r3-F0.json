On small maps it is an absolute joy thanks to its great armament and armor, but on large maps its low speed absolutely ruins it.\n\nCheck the channel \"About\" section for the link to the creator of my profile picture.\n\nSongs used (in order from first to last):\nCommand and Conquer: Generals OST\n\nSecond channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_z0IvBt9VKgVY9_CgThzIA\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/spookston\n\n#warthunder\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #tanks\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b #warthundergameplay  \nThe Slowest Tank In War Thunder"
