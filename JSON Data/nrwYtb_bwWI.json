Do not expect too many of these (lol), but figured at least one was due! I wanna improve more before I start making more videos on ground. Otherwise, enjoy, and please- make sure you learn from my commentary, and not my gameplay! Like I said, improvements are still to be made.\n\nI'm sure there's plenty of great tips I missed in the video, please, feel free to drop any advice you might have in the comments! If you're new, pay attention to the video, read the comments, and fix those skill issues :)\n\nLast thing- SQUADRON HAS BEEN MADE!!!! If you're interested in joining, please do send in an application! The tag is =Nimbo= (=Soup= was taken, of course). The only requirement is 5 matches in any realistic battles. We've got plenty of space, and we'd love to have you in!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCome check me out on Twitch, where it all began!
