War Thunder ground was a pain, and while we did not drop a nuke, I still got a few high kill Ground RB Games. The War Thunder gameplay was on PC, and not War Thunder Mobile. This video can almost serve as a War Thunder beginners guide, and will be a useful resource to newer players. There is also a lot of War Thunder funny moments. I hope you enjoy :)\n\n#warthunder #funnymoments #tanks"
