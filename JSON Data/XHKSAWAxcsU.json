            "Description": "Ki-32 is a low battle rating light bomber in Japanese tank tree. In my opinion it's one of the best planes to have in the line up early on if you want to provide close air support in realistic ground battles.\n\nBuy something on Gaijin store through my link and get a 3% discount+decal*\nWhile I get 3% share of the revenue. EVERYBODY WINS!**\nhttps://tinyurl.com/HowToPlay1337\n*The 3% discount for consumers will not stack on top of already discounted items, and the decal can only be obtained once per account.\n**Except Gaijin, I believe they should lose that same amount (so 6% in total) noobs :D\n\nGUIDES and THEORYCRAFTING \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O3MBjdSsIk&list=PLm8f2d8gbBSHiZQ3mY7eRgSwnXk2CVG4G\n\nSTRANGEST VEHICLES in War Thunder\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSz-X-WvGeo&list=PLm8f2d8gbBSEAd0eLFM4Sv_u1SRV3d6vQ\n\nCLOSE AIR SUPPORT (in ground battles) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I10InKIMHf8&list=PLm8f2d8gbBSElq2a2EBlyru9qgary_5Zj\n\nALL TANK REVIEWS\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grWpd6A4zbY&list=PLm8f2d8gbBSGxUcDcCtFoHsqMbKi-P4Sf\n\n#WarThunder  #WT #HowToPlay1337"
