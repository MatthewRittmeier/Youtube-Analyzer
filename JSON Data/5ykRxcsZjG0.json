I decided to try my hand at making a galaxy in the Desmos graphing calculator. When I shared the graph in the Desmos discord server, someone suggested I make a quasar, so I gave that a shot as well.\nBoth of these ended up coming out really well, especially the quasar one in my opinion. Weirdly enough, the quasar graph actually runs faster than the galaxy one, despite having more things in it. This is most likely because the way I did the spirals used a much slower method in the galaxy graph than the quasar one.\nHope you enjoy!"
